## What is RetroPlayer?
Retroplayer is a Website for Games, Videos / Movies, Custom Coding things, and More! (Maybe).

The reason this is the 3.0 Version of Retroplayer was because the Other Websites were made using [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com). 

## What are the old RetroPlayer Websites?
Note: The reason everything ends with "matchstudent.org" was because I made it when I was Younger.

The First ever RetroPlayer Website is [Here](https://sites.google.com/matchstudent.org/retroplayer).
The 2nd ever RetroPlayer Website is [Here](https://sites.google.com/matchstudent.org/retroplayer-remastered/home).
